[Chorus]
You on some other shit
You on some other shit
I be on other shit
You on some other shit
The clip it came with the clip
My bitch she came with a bitch
Whip it came with a whip
You on some other shit
What, what, I be on other shit
What, what, I be on other shit
What, what, you on some other shit
What, what, you on some other shit

[Verse 1]
Your clip came with a clip
Your bitch came with a bitch
Saggin' my jeans a bit
Walk with a limp
All of them dig on the squad
Ooh yuh, look at the squad
All of my niggas got cash
Dealin' that hard
All of my niggas got rollies
Ooh yuh, looking like frauds
Look at that bag of the cash ooh yuh
Ain't looking at y'all
Gettin' it in sendin' it out
Cooking that shit the In & Out

[Chorus]
You on some other shit
You on some other shit
I be on other shit
You on some other shit
The clip it came with the clip
My bitch she came with a bitch
Whip it came with a whip
You on some other shit
What, what, I be on other shit
What, what, I be on other shit
What, what, you on some other shit
What, what, you on some other shit

[Verse 2]
I'm on some other shit
Taking my time and shit
Got money for buying this shit
Toting my 9 and shit
Walking designer bitch
Walking and trying on shit
I walked then I walked to the bitch
Walked in and bought the whole kit
I'm on some other shit
You on some other shit
I'm popping them pills on her shoulder bitch
Aye, you fuck with them opps that's other shit
I'm copping her blouse that's some other shit
You fuck with the opps that's some other shit

[Chorus]
You on some other shit
You on some other shit
I be on other shit
You on some other shit
The clip it came with the clip
My bitch she came with a bitch
Whip it came with a whip
You on some other shit
What, what, I be on other shit
What, what, I be on other shit
What, what, you on some other shit
What, what, you on some other shit
