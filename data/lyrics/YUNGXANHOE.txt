[Intro]
Aye, where the molly?
Where the... Where the mothafucking xans?
I'm sad as fuck
Xan, xan, xan, xan, xan (Gotta put some swag on it, right)
Xan, xan, xan, xan, xan
Xan, xan, xan, xan, xan

[Hook]
Xan got me on some other shit
Codeine, lucid dreams bitch I bleed lean
Choppa' with the beam for the money scheme
Got my wrist out the car tryna' make a scene

[Verse]
Purple rain watch it drain through my veins
Left with no guap came back in a range
Switch it up I can't fill my cup unless it's mud
On my blood I cut you off if you ain't talkin' bout nun'
Red bone give me gums got my face numb
Got my thumb through the check go and twerk sum'
Never catch me in the field tripping off a pill
Catch me in a foreign whip, Ferragamo wheels
Holding on my steel
Nigga shit get real
If I let the trigger go then that's just how I feel
Banana clip get peeled
We fucking off a pill
Your bitch over here still
My nigga

[Hook]
Xan got me on some other shit
Codeine, lucid dreams bitch I bleed lean
Choppa' with the beam for the money scheme
Got my wrist out the car tryna' make a scene
Xan got me on some other shit
Codeine, lucid dreams bitch I bleed lean
Choppa' with the beam for the money scheme
Got my wrist out the car tryna' make a scene
