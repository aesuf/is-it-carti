[Intro: Playboi Carti]
I'm with the squad, uh, I'm with the squad (bih)
I'm with the squad (bih), I'm with the squad

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
All of my niggas are loyal
All of my niggas are Gucci (aye, aye, aye, what)
All of my niggas are loyal
All of my niggas are Gucci
Walking around with the toolie
And my lil partner, she shoot
Spending my money, you broke
All of my niggas are thugs
All of my niggas salute (yeah)
I just broke up with my bih
I fell in love with my ruger (pew pew, pew)
I got the Pyrex Vision
Pass me the blunt and I'm hittin it
I whip it, I get it
Actin' a fool in the kitchen
Count it up, count it up, get it (count it up)
Call up the plug, we gettin' it (count it up)
Uber but I ain't in it (count it up)
Boy, get your bands up
Knock it off ho, get ya hands up (count it up)
Been in the block with the handle

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
I got that roll, uh, I, I got the roll
Playin' yo bih (what)
I'm with the squad, I'm with the squad
I'm with the squad, I'm with the squad (pew pew, pew)
I'm with the squad, I'm with the squad (pew pew, pew)
I'm with the squad, I'm with the squad (pew pew, pew)
I'm with the squad, I'm with the squad (pew pew, pew)
I'm with the squad, I'm with the squad (uh, ya)

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
I got that roll, uh, I, I got the roll
Payin' yo bih (what)
I'm with the squad, I'm with the squad
I'm with the squad, I'm with the squad (pew pew, pew)
I'm with the squad, I'm with the squad (pew pew, pew)
I'm with the squad, I'm with the squad (pew pew, pew)
I'm with the squad, I'm with the squad (pew pew, pew)
I'm with the squad, I'm with the squad (uh ya)
