Audi, Bimmer, Benz with the roof up
Still on this goop punch, three gram, boof blunt
High as fuck
Called up some hoes, Let's go to Lenox Square
Might just go icey my wrist, might just go cop me some squares
Keep a small circle, I can't fuck with squares
Ay I had to get it how I got it, nigga life ain't fair
Spilt that lean all on my kicks and got another pair
I say fuck them two hoes man, I got another pair, bitch
Broke boi, broke boi, broke boi, broke boi, broke boi
Broke boi, broke boi, broke boi, broke boi, broke boi

Why should I keep juggin' all these broke boys
In the mall buying ice cause he's a broke boi
I can't even kick it with these broke boys
He ain't come to buy a pack cause he a broke boi

Bitch I'm going through the sack cause I'm no broke boi
Runnin' up the check on these broke boys
Put some bands on your neck and have you murked boy
Bitch I'm ballin' on these niggas, ballin'
Bitch I'm ballin' on these niggas, first they hatin' he's so pussy
Don't cross your partner, pussy, that's a pussy for some pussy
Always talked about me, still ain't never shook me
I'm a real nigga from the Flat can't overlook me
fifteen-hundred nigga if you're tryna come and book me
Niggas gonna fuckin' book me
Keep that choppa on me, my grandma watchin' me
Fuck my Jesus piece, I might squeeze the piece
Hold out on my way, I might flood the streets
And I'm on this lean, I won't make a scene
Nigga front on me, I'mma make a scene
Run up in his shit, run up in his shit
