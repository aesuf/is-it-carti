[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
Hitting that bitch with the fire, notice me
Hitting that boy with the fire, nigga didn't notice me
Hitting that bitch with some fire, he ain't even notice me
Hitting that bitch with the fire, a nigga didn't notice me
Hitting that boy with the fire, they ain't even notice me
They ain't even notice me, they ain't even notice me
They ain't even notice me, they ain't even notice me
They ain't even notice me, they ain't even notice me
Hitting that boy with the fire, nigga didn't notice me

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Tell that lil bitch I got bags, talkin' to mans
Tell that lil bitch I got bags, you talkin' to me
Hittin' that boy with that fire, nigga didn't know it was me
Nigga be dead meat, nigga be dead meat
Hitting that bitch from the side
I'm gonna have a m√©nage
I'm gonna have a good time
I'm gonna fuck her you like
She wanna play with that fire
Shawty gon' play with that fire
These niggas ain't ready for slime, they ain't ready for slime

[Chorus: Playboi Carti & Young Nudy]
Hitting that bitch with the fire, notice me
Hitting that boy with the fire, nigga didn't notice me
Hitting that bitch with some fire, he ain't even notice me
Hitting that bitch with the fire, a nigga didn't notice me
Hitting that boy with the fire, they ain't even notice me
They ain't even notice me, they ain't even notice me
They ain't even notice me, they ain't even notice me
They ain't even notice me, they ain't even notice me
Hitting that boy with the fire, nigga didn't notice me
Yeah

[Chorus: Playboi Carti & Young Nudy]
Hitting that bitch with the fire, notice me (fire, fire, fire)
Hitting that boy with the fire, nigga didn't notice me
Hitting that bitch with some fire, he ain't even notice me (brr)
Hitting that bitch with the fire, a nigga didn't notice me (brr)
Hitting that boy with the fire, they ain't even notice me
They ain't even notice me, they ain't even notice me
They ain't even notice me, they ain't even notice me
They ain't even notice me, they ain't even notice me
Hitting that boy with the fire, nigga didn't notice me
