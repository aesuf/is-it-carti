Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She want to rock with the man
She want to hop in the Lamb', rock with the band
She wanna rock with the gang
Ooh, pop a lil' band
Ooh, I got mo' bands than yo' man
Started from pots and pans to all of these fans
And all these hoes in my pants, ooh, ooh
I walk in that bih', I don't dance, ooh
She drippin', lil' bitch, she don't dance, ooh
Holdin' my dick with no hands, ooh
She coolin' me off with no fan, ooh
Free my lil' guy in the jam, ooh
I keep a drum like a band, ooh
We robbin these niggas, no change, ooh
Then I take that to the floor, ooh
