[Verse 3: Playboi Carti]
Ey, designer this, designer that
Ey, exotic bitch, exotic pack
I can't bitch on the scene, boy, I'm in the trap
She can't wear no leggings around me, boy, I don't like that
Took his bitch with my wrist, he ain't like that
Loud pack, rollin' on my iPad
These Versace shades, I can't see that
All white bricks, all white bricks, my Chanel bag
I'm just life for life
I still took that flight
Fucked her the first night
Syrup sit on ice
Cash my appetite
These niggas ain't right
These niggas ain't right
I'm loaded on sight
Damn
