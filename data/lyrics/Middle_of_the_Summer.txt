[Intro: Playboi Carti]
Hold up
You know what I'm saying?
You know I seen Kesha and them back there
Yeah, Kesha
Got muhfuckin' Redd in this bitch
You know what I'm saying?
Know what I'm saying, real playa shit
Me and my bitch lit
Yeah, me and my homie
We do this shit with my hitman
I said we do this shit for a big boy Patek
Walk in that shit, take over that thing

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
I'm in the hood where niggas don't bother me (check it out)
Thirty-five hunnid my cardigan (check it out)
Shawty gon' fuck, shawty gon' swallow me (check it out)
Shawty gon' get on top of me (what, what, what)
All of this ice in the summertime
Ain't no boys fucking with Carti, nah!

[Bridge: Playboi Carti]
Me and my bitch lit, yeah, me and my homie
We do this shit with my hitman
You know what I'm saying?
I can't really complain about shit, man
(I said we do this shit for a big boy Patek)
Everything good, you know what I'm saying?
(Walk in that shit with my bih Red)
(Sippin' red drink nigga!)
Don't give a fuck what it look like

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
I'm in the hood where niggas don't bother me (check it out)
Thirty-five hunnid my cardigan (check it out)
Shawty gon' fuck, shawty gon' swallow me (check it out)
Shawty gon' get on top of me (what, what, what)
All of this ice in the summertime
Ain't no boys fucking with Carti, nah!
I'm in the hood where niggas don't bother me
Thirty-five hunnid my cardigan
Shawty gon' fuck, shawty gon' swallow me
Shawty gon' get on top of me
I'm in the hood where niggas don't bother me
Thirty-five hunnid my cardigan
Shawty gon' fuck, shawty gon' swallow me
Shawty gon' get on top of me
I'm in the hood where niggas don't bother me
Thirty-five hunnid my cardigan
Shawty gon' fuck, shawty gon' swallow me
Shawty gon' get on top of me
