[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
I geek, I geek
All these hoes want a Playboy
I'm ballin', I'm Playboi
I'm smashing, you paid for it
Geek, geek, then pass it like go for it
This Carti I tote for em, I'm shootin' my face showin'
Geek, geek, my diamonds a big deal
Margiela, my feet kill, she poppin' like tip drill
Geek, geek, what's brackin', ay
Geek, geek, jeez, yea
What's brackin on x pills, I'm poppin' them x pills
I flex on my ex still, I fuck on my ex still, I told her to hold still
Geek, geek, geek, geek, yah
