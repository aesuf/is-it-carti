[Chorus]
Shawty gon' nut on the team
3500 for these (3500 for these)
Check please (What)
I got your hoe on a leash, all on her knees, ready to preach (Preach)
Suck on my dick like a leech (Leech)
All of these bitches, they want to fuck Carti, 'cause Carti he got a lil guap (Guap, guap)
Fuck that lil' bih in my car
Diamonds they shine in the dark, I got the K and the sauce
50 round drum in that bih, I'm down with the mob (Mob)

[Refrain]
All of my hitters go hard, all of my niggas go hard
All of my hitters go hard, all of my niggas go off
All of my hitters go off, all of my niggas go off
All of my hitters go off, all of my niggas go off
All of my hitters go off, all of my niggas go off
All of my niggas go off, all of my niggas go off

[Verse]
I put my soul in the mist
You took a shot and you missed
Shawty be clean like a dish
Fuckin' your bitch then I ditch
Smashin' your bih, that lil bih need dish
Lil' ass hoe, lil' ass hoe can't kick
Big bankroll, big bankroll and it's big
Big bankroll, big bankroll, shawty, roll
Thatâ€™s your hoe, better get ya' hoe
Let her go, she ain't tryna go
Let her know
Let her know, let her know, let her go
She nervous, she struggling, she nervous
I think she nervous, she nervous, she nervous
I think she nervous, she nervous, she nervous

[Chorus]
Shawty gon' nut on the team
3500 for these (3500 for these)
Check please (What)
I got your hoe on a leash, all on her knees, ready to preach (Preach)
Suck on my dick like a leech (Leech)
All of these bitches, they want to fuck Carti, 'cause Carti he got a lil guap (Guap, guap)
Fuck that lil' bih in my car
Diamonds they shine in the dark, I got the K and the sauce
50 round drum in that bih, I'm down with the mob (Mob)

[Refrain]
All of my hitters go hard, all of my niggas go hard
All of my hitters go hard, all of my niggas go off
All of my hitters go off, all of my niggas go off
All of my hitters go off, all of my niggas go off
All of my hitters go off, all of my niggas go off
All of my niggas go off, all of my niggas go off

[Outro]
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, slatt
