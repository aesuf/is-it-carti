What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, huh

How you pull up on that bitch
We get the guap and we kick it
Shawty gon' suck like a tick
Diamond they look like it's dancin'
I pour the lean in the Mist
I cannot handle no shit
Shawty just handle this shit
I pop the perc and I kick
We get the guap and we kick it
I get the guap and I split (split)
Split the whole thing with my clique
VVS diamond on my wrist
My diamond not Tiffany bitch
Under no light and it hit
All of these bitches we hit
Fuckin' that bitch
Shawty bitch look like a bitch
Hittin' that shit
Forty clip came wit' the stick
Yeah, rockin' the shows
Got em like whoa
Fuckin' these hoes
Dodgin' them hoes
Keepin' the pole
Got her on go
You know how it go
Got her on road
In love with my roll
Count up bankroll
Ain't lovin' them hoes
That's when I roll
