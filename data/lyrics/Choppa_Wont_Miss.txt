[Chorus: Playboi Carti & Young Thug]
Choppa won't miss a nigga (choppa won't miss a nigga)
Choppa won't miss a nigga (choppa won't miss a nigga)
Choppa won't miss a nigga
100 round drum killin' everybody (pew, pew, pew)
100 round drum killin' everybody (pew, pew, pew)
Choppa won't miss a nigga (choppa won't miss...)

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti & Young Thug]
She hop on the dick and she split (yeah)
Hop on my dick like a bitch (yeah)
Suck on my dick like a tick
You a copier, Yeah you like to copy shit (Carti)
You ain't even on the style till young Carti popped the shit
I got hella hoes (woah), on some papi shit (woah, woah)
Need to pop a bitch, need a solid bitch, harder than a brick
Choppers on the counter, pints all in the fridge

[Chorus: Playboi Carti & Young Thug]
Choppa won't miss a nigga
Choppa won't miss a nigga (choppa won't miss a nigga)
Choppa won't miss a nigga (choppa won't miss a nigga)
100 round drum killin' everybody
100 round drum killin' everybody
Choppa won't miss a nigga

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti & Young Thug]
Out there running with my gun
Young nigga shoot for fun (for fun)
Put some money on your head, I sell yo ass for 10
I got ice to match the ice, ice to match the fit
I got bitches on top of bitches, and all my bitches 10s
I still don't dance no milly rock, just hide it in my sock
I got bitches in the lot (lot), pouring up the pop (pop)

[Chorus: Playboi Carti and Young Thug]
Choppa won't miss a nigga (choppa won't miss a nigga)
Choppa won't miss a nigga (grrrah, grrah)
Choppa won't miss a nigga (choppa won't miss a nigga)
100 round drum killin' everybody (yeah)
100 round drum killin' everybody
Choppa won't miss a nigga (grrrah, Jeffrey!)

[Chorus: Playboi Carti and Young Thug]
Choppa won't miss a nigga
Choppa won't miss a nigga (choppa won't miss a nigga)
Choppa won't miss a nigga (Reddot)
100 round drum killin' everybody (yeah)
100 round drum killin' everybody
Choppa won't miss a nigga
