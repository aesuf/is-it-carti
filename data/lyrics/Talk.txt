[Verse]
Hold up, who that bangin' on my door?
If a nigga try to rob me imma blow him in his throat
Hold up, uh, don't be blowin' up my phone
Sounding like a lil hoe about some coke you fucking hoe
It's Cartier, these diamonds let you niggas know
You see these hunnids, these hunnids nigga we blow
Fuck her under covers my nigga until the morn'
She say "Carti, why you actin' funny?"
"Ever since you got some money you been frontin' on me"
Say no more
The new cars, the new broads, you so bright but you so lost
Damn, you let the lean get you so gone
Don't let the drugs get you so gone
Don't let the drugs get you so gone
You so bright but you so lost
Sippin' on this act don't know how to act
My little whoadie got my back, he'll blow you back!
My little whoadie got the strap, he'll blow you back!
