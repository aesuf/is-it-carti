Bitch come my way but don't bring nothing my way
All I want is face then get out my face
Yea that nigga hate but he stay in his place place
.38, right in yo face face
Playboi keep a bunny, right in his face face
Ass so fat, she gone give me face face
Ay Feragamo waist, Burberry my taste my taste
Nigga hit my line, 2 phones come my way
I'm with a rich hoe, wait
Tell me where ya stay, tell me where you at
Be right there, go pick em up, hit me right back ay
Four tablespoons, four tablespoons
On this lean, twenty-four nigga
Dogs sendin' twenty foes nigga

Coke, dope, crack, smack, weed, E's and CD's, they got it all
This is a certified hood classic
