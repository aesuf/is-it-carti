[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Ooh, shit, yeah, bih
I put your ho in the Louvre
Yeah I blow smoke out the roof
Feel like 2Pac, got the juice
Feel like 2Pac, got the juice
First I go call up the troops
We run it up like we do
Bitch I go cop me a coupe
Bitch I go cop me a booth
Then I go swool with the loot
Put that lil bih on her back
Told that lil bih to relax
Tell that lil bih I got back
Told that bih I got stacks
Hollup lil bih, that's lil cash
Spend a lil check on the rent
Spend a lil' check on the brick
She got the cake in the back
I got the K in the back
I got my face in the sack
Hit your block hard like some crack
I told that lil' nigga we back
I told that bih we got back
I told that lil' nigga we back
Who that boy there with the bag?
Who that bitch there with the ass?
I sip the lean and the gas
I keep that shit in the back
For that lil' work, bitch I tax
For that lil' verse, bitch I tax
All of these hoes, they attached
Fuckin' your bitch, that's some facts
Half of these niggas, they rats
Half of these niggas, they rats
Hit your block hard with the Gat
Hit your block hard like some crack
