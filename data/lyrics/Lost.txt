I'm not getting geeked, I'm getting lost
I wrap em up I ship em off, I'm like a boss
Can't see the cloud that I'm on
Got a bad ass bitch from New York
Smoke kush, I can't fuck with Newports
In a foreign coupe, killing nigga, no insurance
I'm the realest, I can show you how to do this
Smoking, drinking penicillin, deadest nigga living
Bitch you know I'm in it
Mercedes Benz, got lady friends
They'll do a nigga
They some whores nigga
I let my boys in em'
Feelin' like that nigga
I feel like that nigga
Nigga tried to jack my swag, I'm fillin' this nigga
But bitches know you ain't young carti I'm telling you nigga
Damn
Nigga tried to jack my swag, I'm fillin' this nigga
I'm not getting geeked I'm getting lost

[verse 2]
Hunned thousand bitches boy you know we get it
You stalking all these hoes you pay no attention
Im counting c-notes
Can't smoke no rello's cause im different
Im working my wrists
Filet mignon with your bitch
Ill pipe her down with the dick
She calm me down with the head when im still in that work
My phone chirping like a bitch
I spilled lean on my shirt
Im out here grinding shawdy while your niggas pockets are hurt
Before my hoe says carti she better say sir
Its money to be made
Can't a nigga face
All she do is face
Yellow diamonds keep a hoe thirsty like lemonade
Thereâ€™s money to be made
Getting topped up in the coupe
She loose
My sprite mixed up with goop
Im loose
You fucked that? bitch me too
