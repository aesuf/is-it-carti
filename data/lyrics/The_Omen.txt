Valentino yellow diamond ropes
Got yo' ho on go!
Got a ho, cool with all my hoes
They all share my pole, Uh
I can't share no pole
Gotta keep a scope
Gotta keep a dirty mix
I mixed the whole fo'
Gotta keep my ho
She gon' mix it on the stove
When them cameras gone
I'm trappin' out with my folks
When them cameras gone
Bitch I'm baggin' up a O
When them cameras gone
Bitch I'm count a whole O
Smashing all your hoes
Pass her to my folks
Trying on some clothes
Designer be my 'drobe
Marc Jacobs be my coat
She stressin' on your mind
My dick all in her throat
Ho, go, go, go, Carti
