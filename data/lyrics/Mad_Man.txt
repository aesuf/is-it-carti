[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
Yuh, yuh, yuh
Poppin' these pills in my coupe
I'm on the roof
Move like I'm Batman
Um, damn, what, Margiela mad man
(Margiela, mad, man!)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
These niggas they stealing my flow, talking bout huh?
Boy, I'm stealing your hoe
Taking your hoe to the pad
She getting lit
She tryna suck on the dick
She wanna suck on the dick
She wanna suck like a tick (ooh, yeah, what? uh)
Suck like a tick
Suck on this shit
Give her to clique
Give em the clip
Get on your knees, pray for the dick
Pray for this shit
Pray for my clique
Pray for my niggas
Ooh, ooh, I got my hand on the trigger
I got my hand on her pussy
All of these niggas they pussy
He run away like a wuss
I got the paper like books
I can't pull up, bitch, I'm booked
Walked in that bitch and the bitches, they looked
All of these niggas, these niggas they shook
Twenty-nine hop in the tub
Wash my lil' balls while I make a lil' call
