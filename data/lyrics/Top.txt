[Intro: Playboi Carti]
What? Huh?

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
I'm on the top of the building, I'm on the top of the building
I'm on the top of the building, I'm on the top of the building
I'm on the top of the building, I'm on the top of the building
I'm on the top of the building, I'm on the top of the building
I'm on the top of the building, I'm on the top of the building
I'm on the top of the building, I'm on the top of the building

[Verse: Playboi Carti]
Gripping that nine till I die
Made my first mill in July
I fucked that lil bitch then she cry
I'm in Miami like Plies
Eighty-one thousand that right
Eighty-one thousand that mike
Walk in that bitch and get right
I call up Elliot twice
I get that bitch and get right
I put that bih on that dope
I get that dope that she like
Yeah, Yeah ride like a bike
These niggas they bite
They takin' my swag they swipe
VVS diamonds, I'm in this bih with the dentist
Back-to-back like tennis
I'm in the spot like a chemist
I ain't going out, outside
You're a lil hoe, you can get it
I ain't going out, outside
You're a lil hoe you can get it

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
I'm on the top of the building, I'm on the top of the building
I'm on the top of the building, I'm on the top of the building
I'm on the top of the building, I'm on the top of the building
I'm on the top of the building, I'm on the top of the building
I'm on the top of the building, I'm on the top of the building
I'm on the top of the building, I'm on the top of the building
