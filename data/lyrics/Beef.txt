Who got Who got
Who got beef with me
Who got Who got
Who got beef with me
Who got beef with me
Who got beef with me

I got niggas in the streets do seventy years for me
Kill for me, RIP
Got a hoe all in my bed, she gon' freak for me
I spend a bag and get it back, I flex like Hercules
AK with the beam for who got beef with me
I talk that guapanese, she tryin' rock wit me
And pop a ox wit me, I ball like Barkley
Just bought some Robin jeans, she can't stop topping me
That's why he plot on me, that's why he jock on me
Cuz I get on the beat and answer like it's callin' me
Cuz I get on your hoe and shh, 'cause she callin' me

Who got beef with me
Who got beef with me
Man who got beef with me
Who got beef with me
Beef with me
Who got beef with me
Man who got beef with me
Who got beef with me
Got beef with me
Man I keep that heat up off for who got beef with me
Man I keep that heat up off for who got beef with me
Man I keep that shh up on me for who got beef with me

Who got beef with me
Who got beef with me
Man who got beef with me
Who got beef with me
Beef with me
Who got beef with me
Man who got beef with me
Who got beef with me
Got beef with me
Man I keep that heat up off for who got beef with me
Man I keep that heat up off for who got beef with me
Man I keep that shh up on me for who got beef with me
