[Chorus]
Yeah, bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home

[Verse 1]
She a loyal bitch, you gotta pay for those
She a spoiled lil bitch, I bought her all her clothes
You know I treat you good, I don't wanna meet your hoes
I took you out the hood, I took you to my shows
We took a lot of pics and now we look like goals
We tried some new things, we fucked a couple hoes
You changin' mood swings, you got me on those
We gettin' back in, walked through the back door
You had some surgeries, but it's still fat though
You like the cash girl, you helped the cash grow
You drivin' Lambos, with some leg room
Girl, I'm waiting on you, bring that bag home (ooh)

[Chorus]
Yeah, bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home

[Verse 2]
She don't play with bitches, she don't play with hoes
Yeah she with the shit, she might kill a hoe
If it's 'bout young Carti (okay), yeah, my bitch on go (okay)
When she on that molly (okay), anything goes (okay)
She was in Miami (okay), on a fuckin' boat (okay)
With some ball players (okay), she left them niggas broke (okay)
She said "text my phone" (okay), Tell me I'm alone (okay)
I respond back (okay), "When you comin' home?" (okay)
She respond back (okay), "I was in my zone" (okay)
The money counter on (okay), the money counter on
Hold up, what you talkin' bout, come here
Girl I'm waitin' on you, bring that bag home (ooh)

[Chorus]
Yeah, bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home
