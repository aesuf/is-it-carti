Fly to LA for a week, and I got Rick on my tee
And I got Rick on my feet, choppa on me, saggin' my jeans
And I put that on big B's, ay, shoutout G Weed
I got yo' hoe on the team, runnin' them laps just like a meet
Hunnid bands on the Goyard, ooh
And I got goons in my yard, ooh
We can rock out like guitars, ooh
Hoe I got lean I got bars, ooh, hoe I got lean I got bars, ooh
Hoe I fuck her 'cause I'm hard, ooh
She fuck with me I go hard, hoe I'm on lean I'm on stars
Uh, ay, now we on top of my car
Uh, lookin' at stars like I made it far
Ay, look at my chain, glow in the dark
What, ya thot give brain, she goin' hard
