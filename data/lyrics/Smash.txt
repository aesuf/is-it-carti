[Intro]
Shawty suck my dick in the bathroom
Then she popped a xanny in the bathroom
That's what them racks do
I'm movin' packs too
Nigga come through I'm boomin' in the drive thru

[Bridge]
All I wanted in this life of mine
All I wanted in this life of mine
All I wanted in this life of mine
All I wanted in this life of mine
I can't let a hoe explore my mind
I'm off the dope shit, I'm off my mind
She tryna kick it, I'm never off my grind boy that's mine

[Verse]
Catch me flippin' plays all the time
Coke shawty yeah and yo hoe a sideline
Bad yellow bone stay blowin' my line
Goin' off this check bitch I'm flexin got no time
If I die, you better know
I did a lot of shit that these niggas can't ignore
Fuck a lot of whores
Off these metaphors
Model bitches that niggas can't afford
I just went inside of Phipps and spent on Tom Ford
Shawty suck my dick in the bathroom
Then she popped a xannie in the bathroom
That's what them racks do
I'm movin' packs too
Nigga come through I'm boomin' in the drive thru
And if that nigga lookin' goofy he get robbed too
I ain't one of these lame niggas you be talking to
Bitch Im bout this check don't make me smash on you

[Outro]
Don't make me smash on you
Don't make me smash on you
Don't make me smash on you
Don't make me smash on you
Don't make me smash on you
Don't make me smash on you
Don't make me smash on you
Don't make me smash on you
