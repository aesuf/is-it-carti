[Intro: Playboi Carti]
(Yeah)
Wake up in the mornin' know I gotta do this shit
Ay let's do it
(Cannon)
Yeah, hey, heyo, hey, hey, yeah

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
We ain't got time
I draw my demons out
With my money
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
She a Dime (hol' up)
All these niggas they cappin' right here
They stay lyin'
We ain't got time
I drown my demons out
WIth my money
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
She a Dime (hol' up)
All these niggas they cappin' right here
They stay lyin'

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
We ain't got time
I drown my demons out
With my money
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
She a Dime (hol' up)
All these niggas they cappin' right here
They stay lyin'
We ain't got time
I drop my demons out
With my money
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
She in diamonds (hol' up)
All these niggas they cappin' right here
They stay lyin'

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
My bitch fine
You ain't lyin'
My big bank
These niggas been biting
But my diamonds keep bitin'
These hoes be bitin'
These niggas be bitin'
Bitch I'm the bomb, Bin Laden
Got a bitch on the line right now
Say she got Molly, yeah
Sorry, I don't do sour;
A-W-G-E you know me;
Cold outside I need a long sleeve
Yeah, ballin' on yo' hoe like Kobe
Dunkin' on yo' hoe like no D
Bald head like Gin√≥bili
Piru, watch my nose bleed...
That boy dead
Arm and leg
Head and chest
Turnin' your head, take yo bag

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
We ain't got time
I drown my demons out
With my money
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
She a Dime (hol' up)
All these niggas they cappin' right here
They stay lyin'
We ain't got time
I drop my demons out
With my money
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
She a Dime (hol' up)
All these niggas they cappin' right here
They stay lyin'
