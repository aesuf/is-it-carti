New choppa, new choppa it came with the beam
Actavis pouring up lean
Got Flacko, yeah Rocky, he pass me the beam
I shoot like a king
All of these knots on my jeans, Alexander of McQueen
Diamonds they lookin' like ice, I whip the hoe like I'm Ike
Stack up my cash I got height, take advantage of the Sprite
Take the bando bring the hype
We just go hard in the kitchen
Had to catch up with my bitches
They know that young nigga be living

Run it up, run it up, run it up
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa
Run it up, run it up, run it up
I ain't hearing what you say, I ain't listening what you say
Get the fuck up out the way, go on let a playa play
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa

Run it up, run it up, run it up
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa
Run it up, run it up, run it up
I ain't hearing what you say, I ain't listening what you say
Get the fuck up out the way, go on let a playa play
New choppa, new choppa, new choppa, new choppa
