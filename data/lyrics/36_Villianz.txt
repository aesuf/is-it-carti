You'd be very foolish to not to understand that because demons are real and people are influenced by bad spirits
Yeah, yeah
Carti, yeah

Southside nigga, flat ninja
My niggas take time off yo' clock with the Glock
Purple killing that fool, I smoke dolo by two
Got me high to the roof, got ya' bitch getting loose
Carti that dude, it's blue in these jewels
comes on, three G's, one blunt, just me
Three cunts, come feel with me, drink up uh damn
I'm 'bout them green guys, though I'm serving pies
I'm high—way, lay my ass with you
The truth bitch, this is what I do bitch
This is what I do bitch, nigga fuck you Carti
Fuck 'em all get this cake that's how I pissed them off
I got work that's gon' be gone tomorrow
Ship it off state to state, nigga don't hate
Cartier with your bitch on the interstate
Foreign whip she love—this shit
She ridin' it, rollin' that glass
Roll that gas, bitch I'm the man

All of these bitches
I'm gon' fuck all of these bitches
Fuck what you think
Carti
