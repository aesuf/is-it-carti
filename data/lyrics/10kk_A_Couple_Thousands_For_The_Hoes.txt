Cartier
Sir Cartier

Slowed up, I'm fucked up
Off that two cup sensation
I'm racing, in my mind skrt
Tokyo drift, aye Tokyo pimp
I'm talking to steez, I'm talking to limp
These hoes on my dick
Snort white powder, clam chowder with the bitch
Gotcha bitch
Made my block proud but I still can't trust em
Gotcha baby mama on hold like fuck it
Let me take a stroll told my home boy to tuck it
Seen a pussy nigga then my niggas started bustin

Aye, Monkeys on my draws
She think i'm the man
ten for a verse, I don't say nothing
Smoking on this kush, word to my man
Splurt on my swag, shout out to Japan Carti

Pimp game I got pimp game
Watch me switch lanes in that new thing
Got a bopper bitch wit a pussy ring
She like to hold the work for Yung Carti
I just throw it all in my apartment
Thirsty bitch be quiet
Thirsty bitch be quiet
Nigga's tryna be Yung Carti
Mad cuz I gave yo bitch molly
Nigga I ain't spot yo guap
Throw stacks in the back she don't mind
Hit a nigga in his brain leave him clueless
Real nigga out here I do this
I'm the rudest, should be the shooter
I got hoes, that's your hoe, yeah she know
Every I go, they know they know
Cartier rich nigga on the low 
Cartier rich nigga on the low
I don't ever see a day that I'm poor
I got bitches, ask your hoe, yeah she know
Fuck all these niggas man
We don't give a fuck about nobody nigga

Aye, Monkeys on my draws
She think i'm the man
10 for a verse, hours ain't a thing
Smokin' on this kush, work to my man
Splurt on my swag, shout out to Japan Carti

Aye, Monkeys on my draws
