Bitch, you know I bag it, Raf Simons bag
Perry Ellis bag, call my phone, I bag it
Bought my hoe some Palace, she know that I bag it
Ay yo, Jero, had a bail, he know that I bag it
I'm gon' move that traffic, can't let these opps have it
It’s snowing in my attic, it’s snowing in my yard
My block too hot for all that shit so you don't want no action
Niggas get to blasting, man down, somebody braggin'
Designer jeans, I cash and let a nigga have it
Probably at Follies or we up at Magic
Ay, bitch, I let em have it
She know that I bag it up, he mad cause she bag it up
