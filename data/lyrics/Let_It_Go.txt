I’m with Dro, got that pack, going for the low
I think the Xans tryna tell me something

I came in with a cool hundred
And I got some bitches coming
And I got some bitches calling
I'm with Dro got that pack goin' for the low
Sell a P, sell a O, sell it for the low
If she top, I’m in love, Imma let it go
Let it go, on your block, we gon' do a show

Let it go on your block, I might do a show
He a pussy, he a opp, he gon call the po'
All my niggas they on go, they on fucking go
Got the pole with the scope, know I keep a pole
Why these niggas, why these mans actin like some hoes
In my Ksubi Jeans, bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
That bitch all on me, Terio, Terio, Terio
Got a stripper bitch that depend on me J-Lo J-Lo J-Lo

I came in with a cool hundred
And I got some bitches coming
And I got some bitches calling
I'm with Dro got that pack goin' for the low
Sell a P sell, sell a O, sell it for the low
If she top, I’m in love, Imma let it go
Let it go, on your block, we gon' do a show

Fuck that bitch I'll go till dawn
Rick Owens on top of ones
We don’t do no one on ones
Put that xanny on your tongue
Rock the show, I like to punk
She the type of bitch I love to fuck
Baby you the chosen one
And baby I don’t fall in nothing
Fell asleep in LA, woke up to the sun
Fuck my PO, he know I got hella guns
And shoutout my OG, he know I keep in one
Fuck that SGP, he know I brung the phonk
Hit him with the pump, leave him in the trunk
Would have fucked your baby momma, but it stunk
Beat a nigga ass, leave a nigga lumped

I came in with a cool hundred
And I got some bitches coming
And I got some bitches calling
I'm with Dro got that pack goin' for the low
Sell a P sell, sell a O, sell it for the low
If she top, I’m in love, Imma let it go
Let it go, on your block, we gon' do a show
