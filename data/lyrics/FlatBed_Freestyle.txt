Pussy man I smoke that organic
Fendi down I'm smoking organic

FnN I'm smoke on organic
She bent down, she need some more breath
I got smoke all in the air
Fuck this up and you get left
AP on my fucking left
Stack it up right on the shelf
Yo bitch look familiar
I got drip I let it walk
I got cash, I let it walk
I'ma do this by myself
On the jet byâ€”by myself
I touchdown and shoot the gas tank
I touchdown and get my fingers wet
My bitch getting GOAT head
Riding 'round on mopeds
My bitch off the percocets
Pop that bean and count them deads
Yeah she suck me I can't feel my legs
My bih yucky, she don't use no hands
Dancefloor wit the diamonds dancing
Dancefloor wit the diamonds dancing
That's why you can't buy them bags
In LA I smoke that gas
In LA I link with slatt
That bitch with you, she gave you back
I fuck that bitch and gave her back
I nut on her, she make me 'lax
That gun on me I cannot lack
Your bitch right, she got it clapped
Looking dap boy, young boy you get clapped
I took that lil boy right off of the map
We killed that boy right here, right in the trap
I love my lean, I fucked around relapsed
I fucked that bih, he running round in laps
You touchdown in my city, you better tap
That bitch right here, she know she gotta tap
I seen that bitch runnin' round in Nudy cat
That bitch with me and now she on that pack
I'm in south side, and I'm weighin' the crack
I'm in south side, yeah, and I got the gat
I'm in south side, and I hang with blatt
I'm in south side, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

Too much lean, too much ice
One more pint, one more pint
Too much lean, too much ice
One more pint, one more pint
One more pint, one more pint
One more pint, one more pint
Too much lean, too much ice
One more pint, one more pint
