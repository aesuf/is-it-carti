[Intro]
Ayy
Money counter, fuck a bank, money counter, fuck a bank
Cash Carti, Carti
Cash Carti, ayy, ayy (Ayy, yeah)

[Chorus]
Robin jeans with the wings, she pop a bean and fuck my team
Ridin' with a triple beam, I put that shit on everything
Lookin' like I robbed a bank, Triple C's made her faint
Servin' fiends, switchin' lanes, money counter, fuck a bank
Money counter, fuck a bank, money counter, fuck a bank
Triple C's made her faint, servin' fiends, switchin' lanes
Money counter, fuck a bank, money counter, fuck a bank
Money counter, fuck a bank, money counter, fuck a bank

[Verse]
Uh, on my jewelry man, I spent that on my jewelry man (Uh)
On my jewelry man, I can't tuck no jewelry man (Uh)
Really 'bout them bands, I'm like, "Fuck the jury, man" (Uh)
Nigga, ain't playin', boolin' with my tooly, man (With my tooly, man)
With my tooly man, trappin' with my fully mag (Uh)
With my fully mag, blowin' on that stupid stank
It was just the other day, damn, I couldn't make a play
All a nigga had was faith, now I'm countin' everyday, yeah

[Bridge]
Everyday, yeah, Cash Carti

[Chorus]
Robin jeans with the wings, she pop a bean and fuck my team
Ridin' with a triple beam, I put that shit on everything
Lookin' like I robbed a bank, Triple C's made her faint
Servin' fiends, switchin' lanes, money counter, fuck a bank
Money counter, fuck a bank, money counter, fuck a bank
Triple C's made her faint, servin' fiends, switchin' lanes
Money counter, fuck a bank, money counter, fuck a bank
Money counter, fuck a bank, money counter, fuck a bank
