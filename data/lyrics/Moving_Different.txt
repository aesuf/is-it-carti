Wake up early, I was servin'
Sixteen servin', I was servin'

Yeah, I got the curtains, niggas cannot look
Yeah, I see them lurking
VVS my diamonds, margiela my fit
Bad bitches they call me, I don't have no

And I ain't got my way, bitches on my dick
Bitches on the tip, bitches want my dick
I got guns like TIP, all my money flip
Switch up on a bitch

Pass her to my clique
Ice all on my clique, yeah, I paid for it

Oh lord, I been
Movin' different, seein' colors
New bitches, same brothers
Miley Cyrus, off the molly

Moving different, different colors
Shine together, we bond together
Fall in love, let's fall in love
