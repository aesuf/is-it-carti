(Pipe up)
Aye sauce em' up like melo
Aye sauce em' up like melo
She can't even come over unless she bring her friend no fellow
Aye sauce em' up like melo
She can't even come over unless she bring her friend no fellow
Yung Carti Yung Creflo
Count em' up like Creflo
(Pipe up!)
Shooters on my front porch
(Pipe up!)
Serve you at the front door
(Pipe up!)
Goons, Thugs, Cutthroats
(Pipe up!)
How could I front those
Them blocks, them blocks, them blocks
Yeah we run those
My chain, my watch, my watch
Yeah i'm so cold (money bags)
Nigga's talkin' fashion 'bout that action
I went nino uh
Moving in a rover
Moving with a odour
Zill out than I go out
Yo bitch make me throw up
Diamonds do the hold up
Make a play than pour up
Diamonds do the hold up
Make her play than-- aye
Posted in the booth with the boof
Posted in the booth with the boof
That bitch ain't fucking we gone kick her off the roof
She said "ya'll niggas speak the truth"
We say true
Countin' up, fillin' up me trues
She ain't gotta ask me what I do
Thumbin' through the check with my crew
(She gone fuck on me, then my crew)
(She gone fuck on me, then my crew)
