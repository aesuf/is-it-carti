Got young Navi on the phone, he asking for some wock
Got some bitches in my home, they cookin' on the pot
Know some niggas in the A, still trappin' at the spot
And we robbing all you niggas, we taking off your top
Iâ€™m in Fulton with the slimes, we pull up with them mops
And when I'm talking, 'bout the Mob, that's Harlem to the Bronx
I use to ride round with that Glock, but now I'm way too hot
Got some niggas who do time for Carti, 'cause they got they Guap
Got some paparazzi looking at me, waiting on the flop
Fuck these little niggas hating, snitching like some cop
